Drug discovery starts with identifying and validating potential drug targets and subjecting them to high throughput screening against a library of drug-like molecules or rational drug design. Proteins form the majority of approved drug targets (Hopkins, 2002). This knowledge enables the classification of the human proteome as approved drug targets and non-targets. A drug-target proteins are druggable. This means the protein can fold and have a binding site that interacts with small drug-like molecules (Xu _et al_., 2007). The protein's binding site has certain structural and physiochemical properties and shows high-affinity site-specific binding to the drug-like molecule. Also, a potential drug-target protein is linked to a disease process or pathway and is structurally and functionally characterized. A protein's druggability can be predicted by analyzing the binding site properties (Cheng _et al_., 2007). A study by Bakheet et al., 2009 where they analyzed the druggability of proteins that were not approved drug targets, using a bioinformatics approach, showed that 668 of such proteins have drug target-like properties. This indicates that the number of druggable proteins is substantially larger (Imming _et al., _2006). Further studies have been conducted to categorize the druggable proteins into families. A study conducted by Rask-Anderson _et al_., showed that 44% of human drug targets are made of up G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), enzymes were found to be 29% and 15% were transporter proteins.

Protein-targeted therapies can be categorized into several approaches, including:

1\. Small molecule inhibitors: Small drug-like molecules are designed to bind to a specific protein’s active site to either modulate or inhibit the activity of the protein in a diseased pathway. An example is Erlotinib (Tarceva) which targets EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer (Zhong et al., 2021)

2\. Monoclonal antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies are engineered to recognize and bind to specific proteins, marking them for destruction or blocking their activity. An example is Trastuzumab (Herceptin) which targets HER2-positive breast cancer (Vicidomini et al., 2023)

3\. Protein-protein interaction inhibitors: These involve interactions between proteins where the formation of complexes that drive cancer progression is prevented (Vicidomini et al., 2023).
