Proteins are linear chains of amino acids that are folded into 3D and 4D structures and these orderly folded amino acids determine the function of the protein. Proteins are vital molecules that play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. In cancer, proteins are often dysregulated, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Therefore, proteins have become attractive targets for cancer drug discovery.

One of the primary reasons proteins are ideal targets for cancer therapy is their involvement in key signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and survival. For instance, proteins like HER2, EGFR, and VEGFR are overexpressed in various types of cancer, leading to enhanced tumor growth and angiogenesis. Targeting these proteins with specific inhibitors can effectively block tumor progression (Shen _et al_., 2008).

Another advantage of targeting proteins is the potential for high specificity and reduced toxicity. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which affects both cancerous and healthy cells, protein-targeted therapies can be designed to selectively bind to cancer-specific proteins, minimizing harm to normal tissues (Zafar _et al_., 2021)

Protein-targeted therapies can be categorized into several approaches, including:

1\. Small molecule inhibitors: These are designed to bind to specific protein active sites, inhibiting their activities, eg. Erlotinib (Tarceva) which targets EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer (Zhong et al., 2021)

2\. Monoclonal antibodies: These are engineered to recognize and bind to specific proteins, marking them for destruction or blocking their activity. Example is Trastuzumab (Herceptin) which targets HER2-positive breast cancer (Vicidomini et al., 2023)

3\. Protein-protein interaction inhibitors: These disrupt interactions between proteins, preventing the formation of complexes that drive cancer progression (Vicidomini et al., 2023).

Proteins are attractive targets for cancer drug discovery due to their involvement in key signaling pathways and potential for high specificity. While challenges remain, ongoing research and innovative approaches hold promise for developing effective protein-targeted therapies that can improve cancer treatment outcomes.
